# Strings

Strings can be declared using `'` or `"` quotes. 

```koto
print! 'Hello, World!'
check! Hello, World!

print! "Welcome to Koto ðŸ‘‹"
check! Welcome to Koto ðŸ‘‹

print! 'This is a string
that spans
several lines.'
check! This is a string
check! that spans
check! several lines.
```

Strings can be joined together with the `+` operator.

```koto
print! 'a' + 'Bc' + 'Def'
check! aBcDef
```

Individual elements of a String can be accessed via indexing with `[]` braces.

```koto
print! 'abcdef'[3]
check! d
print! 'ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¥³ðŸ˜†'[1]
check! ðŸ¥³
```

## String interpolation

Assigned values can be included in a String by prefixing them with `$`.

```koto
xyz = 123
print! 'The value of xyz is $xyz'
check! The value of xyz is 123
```

The `$` prefix can also be used to include the results of expressions surrounded with `{}` curly braces.

```koto
print! '2 plus 3 is ${2 + 3}.'
check! 2 plus 3 is 5.
```

## String Escape codes

Strings can contain the following escape codes to define special characters,
all of which start with a `\`. 

- `\n`: Newline
- `\r`: Carriage Return
- `\t`: Tab
- `\'`: Single quote
- `\"`: Double quote
- `\\`: Backslash
- `\$`: Dollar
- `\u{NNNNNN}`: Unicode character
  - Up to 6 hexadecimal digits can be included within the `{}` braces.
    The maximum value is `\u{10ffff}`.
- `\xNN`: ASCII character
  - Exactly 2 hexadecimal digits follow the `\x`.

```koto
print! '\$\'\"'
check! $'"
print! 'Hi \u{1F44B}'
check! Hi ðŸ‘‹
```

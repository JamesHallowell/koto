# Prelude

Koto's prelude is a collection of core library items that are automatically 
made available in a Koto script without the need for calling `import`.

The modules that make up the core library are all included in the 
prelude, along with the following core library functions.

- [`io.print`](../core/io#print)
- [`koto.type`](../core/koto#type)
- [`test.assert`](../core/test#assert)
- [`test.assert_eq`](../core/test#assert-eq)
- [`test.assert_ne`](../core/test#assert-ne)
- [`test.assert_near`](../core/test#assert-near)
